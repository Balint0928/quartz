As a bard, you can use your performances to manipulate the ambient Aether inside others. This feature calls these Songs, but you are free to reimagine what these performances are.

You learn one Song that you can perform during a [[Short Rest]].

- **Song of War:** If you play this song, all allies within 30 ft gain +2 to their attacks for the first three rounds of combat.
