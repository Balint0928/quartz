Short Rests are at least 1 hour long, that you can spend with light activity, treating wounds, eating etc. When you finish the rest, you gain the following benefits:

- **Spend Hit Dice.** You can spend one or more of your Hit Dice to regain Hit Points For each Hit Point Die you spend in this way, roll the die and add your Constitution modifier to it. You regain Hit Points equal to the total (minimum of 1 Hit Point). You can decide to spend an additional Hit Point Die after each roll.
- **Recharge Feature.** Some features are recharged by a Short Rest. If you have such a feature, it recharges in the way specified in its description.
- **Reduce Exhaustion**. You can consume an extra portion of Ration, to clear a point of Exhaustion. This can only happen once per long rest

***Interrupting the Rest.*** A Short Rest is stopped by the following interruptions:

- Rolling Initiative
- Casting a spell other than a cantrip
- Taking any damage or level of [[Exhaustion]]

An interrupted Short Rest confers no benefits.
