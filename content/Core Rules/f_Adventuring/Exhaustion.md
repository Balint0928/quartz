A statistic showing the mental and physical toll of adventuring. Each point of exhaustion has the following effect:

- -1 to all ability checks for each point of Exhaustion you have

If you gain 10 Exhaustion, your body gives out and you die.

**Recovering from exhaustion:**

An [[Extended Rest]] removes all levels of Exhaustion.

A [[Long Rest]] removes 3 levels of Exhaustion.

A [[Short Rest]] removes 1 level of Exhaustion if you consume a Ration. (this can only happen once per Long rest)
