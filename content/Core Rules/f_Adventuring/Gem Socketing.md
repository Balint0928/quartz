Mana infused gems can be socketed into mundane weapons, armor or shield if the item has a socket.

This system replaces the +1/+2/+3 item variants

# Gem Rarities
Gems come in 3 rarities:

- Regular (Uncommon)
- Flawless (Rare)
- Royal (Very Rare)

# Cutting Gems
Gems found while adventuring will rarely fit a socketed weapon. For this purpose, a character with proficiency in [[Jeweler's Kit]], can attempt to cut and refine the gem. The process takes 2 hours per tier of the gem.

| Rarity   | DC  |
| -------- | --- |
| Regular  | 15  |
| Flawless | 20  |
| Royal    | 25  |
If a check is failed by 5 or more, the gem breaks, and is unusable.

# Socketing Gems
Once a gem is cut to socket able size, any character can take 1 minute to apply the gem to a weapon with an empty socket.

A socketed gem can be removed from its socket by any creature over a course of 1 minute. At the end of the 1 minute, roll a 1d10. On a 5 or lower, the gem breaks as it is removed, and cannot be used anymore. Being proficient and using a Jeweler’s Kit, allows a character to reduce the chances of the gem breaking.

A jeweler can ask anywhere from 100 -1.000 gp for cutting a gem, based on its type, rarity and the jeweler’s skill.

# Gem Types
A gem has the following damage type associated with it, based on its type.

| **Gems**    | **Damage Type** |
| ----------- | --------------- |
| Quartz      | Lightning       |
| Black Pearl | Necrotic        |
| Emerald     | Acid            |
| Opal        | Psychic         |
| Pearl       | Radiant         |
| Amber       | Thunder         |
| Ruby        | Fire            |
| Sapphire    | Cold            |
## Gem in a weapon
A weapon socketed with a gem, gains bonus to its attack and damage rolls, and acts as a magic weapon for overcoming resistances. The weapon’s extra damage’s type is dependent on the type of gem used.

## Gem in an Armor or Shield
An armor socketed with a gem, gains bonus to its AV, and grants resistance against the type determined by the gem.

A shield socketed with a gem, gains bonus to its AV, but gains no extra benefit based on the type of gem socketed.

## Bonuses by Rarity

| Rarity   | Attack & Damage bonus | AV & Resistance |
| -------- | --------------------- | --------------- |
| Regular  | +1                    | +1              |
| Flawless | +2                    | +2              |
| Royal    | +3                    | +3              |

## Cost of a socket
A blacksmith or similar artisan can create a socket for a mundane nonmagical weapon armor or shield that has no sockets already.

| Type   | Cost   |
| ------ | ------ |
| Weapon | 100 GP |
| Shield | 300 GP |
| Armor* | 500 GP |
*Not every type of Armor can be socketed
