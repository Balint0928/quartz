You can carry a number of Bulk that equals 5 x your Strength Modifier. If you carry more, you become encumbered, your speed is halved, and you gain Disadvantage on all attack rolls, and Dexterity and Strength saving throws and checks. You cannot carry more than 10 x your Strength Mod.

Light items can be bundled together, for each 10, it makes 1 Bulk.
