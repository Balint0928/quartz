# Exhaustion and Rests
Adventuring takes a toll on a character, either through damage, [[Aether Fatigue]], or through [[Exhaustion]]. To regain lost hit points, reduce Exhaustion, repair equipment and recharge expended resources, characters can take rests.

There are three main types of rests:
- [[Extended Rest]]
- [[Long Rest]]
- [[Short Rest]]

# Inventory
Inventory space is simplified into using [[Bulk]].

# Upgrading Weapons and Armor
The most common way an Adventurer can improve the power of their Armor and Weapons, is by a practice called [[Gem Socketing]].
