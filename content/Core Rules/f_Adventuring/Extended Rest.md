An Extended Rest must be at least 24 hours long, in a safe and comfortable place. A character can do anything while having an Extended Rest, except for fighting, casting spells, or gaining Exhaustion in any form. An extended Rest clears all levels of Exhaustion, [[Aether Fatigue]] and any class resource or feature fully. 

After finishing an Extended Rest, you gain the Well Rested condition, that grants a +1 bonus to Ability checks and Saving throws. For each consecutive 24 hours spent this way, the bonus increases by another 1, up to a maximum of +5. Upon gaining a level of Exhaustion, this bonus is lost.
