A long rest lasts for at least 8 hours, where you sleep, eat and do light activity.

After you finish a long rest, you regain all missing HP, reduce your Exhaustion by 3, and recharge any ability or resource that recharges on a Long rest.

**Interrupting the Rest.** A Long Rest is stopped by the following interruptions:

- Rolling Initiative
- Casting a spell other than a cantrip
- Taking any damage or level of [[Exhaustion]]
- 1 hour of walking or other physical exertion.

If you rested at least 1 hour before the interruption you gain the benefits of a [[Short Rest]].

You can resume a Long Rest immediately after an interruption. If you do so, the rest requires 1 additional hour per interruption to finish.
