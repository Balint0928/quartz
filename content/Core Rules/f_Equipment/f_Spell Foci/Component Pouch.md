A novice casterâ€™s best friend, a component pouch is a small, watertight leather belt pouch that has compartments to hold all the material components and other special items you need to cast your spells, except for those components that have a specific cost (as indicated in a spell's description). When you finish a long rest, and you have casted a spell (that had a material component) since your last long rest, you must roll a 1d20. On a 5 or lower, your pouch is running low on components. You have just enough left for one more spell.
