This kit contains vials, alembics, and other alchemical supplies.

You can use this kit to create alchemical items you know the recipes for. In addition, you may also use this kit to experiment with new materials that you discover to unlock new recipes.

By default, concoctions created with this supply, cannot be used in combat. Their onset times are all between 1 minute and multiple hours. However, a master alchemist can create Tinctures, that are usable in combat.
