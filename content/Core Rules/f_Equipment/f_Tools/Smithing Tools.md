A Smithing tool allows you to work metal, heating it to alter its shape, repair damage, or work raw ingots into useful items.

Proficiency with this tool, grants you the ability to repair broken items, weapons and armor. During a short rest, you can use a maximum amount of charges that equal your proficiency bonus, to repair items. (During a long rest, you can expend more charges for more repairs) This can be used to restore AV to armor and shields. The amount you can restore depends on the type of weapon or armor.


| Type         | AV restored per charge |
| ------------ | ---------------------- |
| Light Armor  | 3                      |
| Medium Armor | 2                      |
| Heavy Armor  | 1                      |
| Shields      | Half its maximum       |
