Gems found while adventuring will rarely fit a socketed weapon. For this purpose, a character with proficiency in Jeweler’s Tools, can attempt to cut and refine the gem. The process takes 2 hours per tier of the gem.

If a check is failed by 5 or more, the gem breaks, and is unusable.

Once a gem is cut to socket able size, any character can take 1 minute to apply the gem to a weapon with an empty socket.

A socketed gem can be removed from its socket by any creature over a course of 1 minute. At the end of the 1 minute, roll a 1d100. On a 50 or lower, the gem breaks as it is removed, and cannot be used anymore. Being proficient and using a Jeweler’s Kit, allows a character to reduce the chances of the gem breaking.
