Dwarves were created by the God of creation Rhuntar the Sculptor, from minerals and rocks to create a servants who can fit inside the tunnels of the earth. Since, dwarves have travelled beyond the deepest caverns of the Dark Depths and have settled in many parts of the surface world.

Dwarves, after so many millennia, still cling to their roots and customs, and are overall a really tight knight race. Their skin and body are made from minerals and stones, just like in the elden days. New dwarves are born in a special kind of process, where the parents sculpt and create their offspring from stones, minerals or even gems. The process is highly sacred, and need a special “divine spark” (soul) to come to reality.

# Lineages

## Silver Dwarf
A lineage that is drawn to to the high mountains and plateaus. These dwarves are masters of living at high altitudes. They get their names from the silvery sheen of their skin, as dwarves believe that Silver is associated with the sky and the air, so they sculpt their kin from this metal.

## Golden Dwarf

A lineage who dwell in many diverse places of the world, but mainly near and around Human settlements and metropolitan areas. These dwarves have a golden skin, and believe that gold is the ore of kings, and so they are natural rulers, merchants and wealth seekers.

## Obsidian Dwarf

A lineage who usually dwell below the earth, in deep caverns and tunnels. Their shiny obsidian skin is tough and their eyes are well adjusted to the darkness.
