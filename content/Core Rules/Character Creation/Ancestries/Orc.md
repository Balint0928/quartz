Orcs originate themselves from an ancient tribe of humans. The tribe was a worshipper of Dhassyl, and they prayed to her for power and guidance to survive an a time of turmoil. Dhassyl granted them the power but it twisted and changed their bodies. The three leaders then separated and orcs started multiplying fast as most orcs are born as twins and triplets. Orcs are blessed by Dhassyl and are able to adapt to any environment much faster than any other creatures. They mostly prefer freedom and strength over cosmopolitan societies and politics.
