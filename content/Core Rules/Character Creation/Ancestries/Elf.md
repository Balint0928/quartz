Elves originate from the Elderwild. They all left the land of the fey behind for different reasons, and have settled in the material plane. They still have strong ties to the fey powers of the world, and are naturally drawn to ley lines and places where The Veil is thin and the Elderwild’s essence can seep into Abithas.

# Lineages

## Au’anrah

The first elves to arrive to Abithas. They were originally fey who belonged to the court of the Archfey Anrahtia, who fell in love with the god Homolon. As Anrathia was the guardian of the well of souls, Homolon used this to access it. When Roseris discovered this, he banished Anrahtia from the elderwild and their court followed their ruler. Ever since they long for their old home, and believe that if they live good lives, they are granted to return to Tír nan Nóg. Au’anrah have sparkly skin and eyes, their hair end in translucent strands, and their limbs in different swirling colours.
