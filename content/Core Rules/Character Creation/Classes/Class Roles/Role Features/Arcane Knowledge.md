You gain proficiency in Arcana, and so gain the ability to identify spells and magical effects even in combat.

You can use your Arcana Knowledge check as a reaction, when a spell is cast within 60 feet of you, to find out the nature of the spell being cast. When you do so, you cannot make a check action on your next turn.
