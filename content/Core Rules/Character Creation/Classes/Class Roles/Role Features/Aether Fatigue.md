When you cast spells, or interact with the arcane on certain levels, you accrue Aether Points that will tire you out physically, and mentally.

You can have a maximum amount of AP (Aether Points) that equals your spellcasting modifier + your Magic level.

When you cast a spell of 1st level or higher, roll a spellcasting ability check against a DC of 11 + the level of the spell you casted. On a fail, you gain a AFP that equals the spell’s level. If you fail by more than 5, the amount of AP gained doubles.

Additionally, when you lose concentration on a spell involuntarily, you also gain AP that equals half the spell’s level (rounded down, but cannot be lower than 1).

If your AP reaches its max, you are on the verge of collapse! If you suffer further fatigue, each AP you gain also causes 1d4 HP of injury and a point of [[Exhaustion]].

When you finish a long rest, you lose all AP.
