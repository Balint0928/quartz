You can implore your deity's assistance with a task or minor problem. The aid can usually be along the lines of spell effects up to third level.

To perform a miracle you need to meet these requirements:

- Expand a point of Divine Focus.

- Not having committed any anathemas since your last long rest.

- Roll a 1d100. You must roll below 10 x your character level.

Once you use this feature successfully, you cannot do so until you finish an [[Extended Rest]]
