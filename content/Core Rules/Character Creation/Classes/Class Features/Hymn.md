When you use your [[Aether Channel]] feature from the Magical role, you can instead start a hymn, prayer or sermon to your deity. When you do so, and you haven't committed any Anathemas since your last long rest, you regain 1 Divine focus point, 2 if you have done things that appeased your deity especially.
