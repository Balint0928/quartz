You call on your experiences and studies to identify something that might repel your foe.

When you succeed on a [[Martial Knowledge]] check against your [[Hunter's Mark]] target, you can choose to activate this feature instead of learning new information. When you do so, gain the following benefits:

- Instantly learn the target’s highest Weakness (if tied you learn one randomly)

- Your attacks become magical against them until the end of your next turn.

- Until the end of your next turn your attack will trigger the target’s highest Weakness, but this doesn’t change your attacks damage type.

- If the target has no Weakness, it gains Weakness against your weapon or unarmed attacks until the end of your next turn. The Weakness equals your proficiency bonus.
