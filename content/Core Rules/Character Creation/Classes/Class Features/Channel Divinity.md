You can use your Divine Focus charges to activate your Channel divinity feature. Depending on the type of Focus used (Chaos or Law) the effect is augmented or changed.

At level 2 you gain the following options:

### Healing Hands: 

Action, restore wisdom + magical level HP to a creature.

- **Law:** The target can also add their constitution modifier to the healing amount

- **Chaos:** You can expend your hit die, roll it, reduce your current HP by the rolled amount, and add it to the healing.


### Harming Hands:

Action, melee spell attack, 1 target, wisdom + magical level radiant or necrotic damage to a creature.

- **Law:** The target must succeed on a charisma save against your spell save dc. On a fail, they cannot gain advantage or score critical hits on their attacks until the end of your next turn.

- **Chaos:** The target must succeed on a charisma save against your spell save dc. On a fail, they gain disadvantage on its attacks until the start of your next turn.
