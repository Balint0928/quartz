Trance is when a barbarian's passion governs them and lands them prowess in battle. You can enter Trance as a bonus action, and when you do so you gain temporary HP that equals your Martial level + your Constitution mod. When you enter Trance, you can choose which emotion guides your Trance:

- Rage: You gain bonus to your Strength based damage rolls, checks and saves that equals your proficiency bonus.
- Desperation: You can make an extra attack as a bonus action each turn.
- Recklessness: Your attack rolls are made with advantage and attack rolls against you are made with advantage.

You can use a bonus action on your turn to switch between emotions.

Your Trance lasts for 1 minute. It ends early if you are knockedÂ unconscious
or if your turn ends and you haven't attacked a hostile creature since your last turn or taken damage since then. You can also end your rage on your turn as a bonus action.

Once your Trance ends, you gain a level of Exhaustion.
