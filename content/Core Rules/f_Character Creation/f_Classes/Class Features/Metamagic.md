As your [[Aether Fatigue]] increases, so does your mastery over the arcane. This is a dangerous dance, many sorcerers loose eventually.

As your AP increases you unlock the usage of the following Metamagic options. Using a metamagic on a spell has different AP increases based on the metamagic and the level of the spell.


| Current AP | Metamagic options                                            |
| ---------- | ------------------------------------------------------------ |
| 3          | [[Subtle Spell]], [[Distant Spell]], [[Careful Spell]]       |
| 6          | [[Empowered Spell]], [[Extended Spell]]                      |
| 9          | [[Quickened Spell]], [[Heightened Spell]], [[Twinned Spell]] |
