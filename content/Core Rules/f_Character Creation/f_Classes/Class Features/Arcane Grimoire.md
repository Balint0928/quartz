Your Grimoire is your most prized possession as a Wizard. It contains your spells, your research, and notes on the arcane. 

### Tier of your Grimoire
Your Grimoire has a Tier associated to it, that represents the potential of power it can manipulate. The Tier can be increased by enchanting the Grimoire with special materials. You can only use a Grimoire that has a Tier appropriate to your Wizard level.


| Tier | Minimum Wizard level |
| ---- | -------------------- |
| 0    | 1                    |
| 1    | 3                    |
| 2    | 6                    |
| 3    | 9                    |
Each time a Grimoire increases a Tier, it gains some extra special powers based on the part enchanted (Cover, Spine, Pages) and the material used.

### Spells known
At level 1, your Grimoire starts with 3 level 1 spells of your choice from the wizard spell list.

### Spell Research
As a wizard, you are capable of researching and experimenting with magical formulas, in hopes of one day, featuring your name next to a spell.

During a long rest, you can research, experiment and string together a random spell formula. The formula is unstable, and is only usable once. A formula not used, becomes obsolete after 24 hours. The level of the spell you create this way cannot be higher than the tier of your current Grimoire (Tier 0 at base)

**Step 1:** Roll for spell Formulae

**Step 2:** The DM and the Player works together to determine the effect of the spell, that is appropriate for its potential level.

**Step 3:** Gain a point of permanent AP that equals the spell's level, until the spell is used or is lost.
