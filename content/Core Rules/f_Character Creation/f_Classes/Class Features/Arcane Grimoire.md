Your Grimoire is your most prized possession as a Wizard. It contains your spells, your research, and notes on the arcane. 

### Tier of your Grimoire
Your Grimoire has a Tier associated to it, that represents the potential of power it can manipulate. The Tier can be increased by enchanting the Grimoire with special materials. You can only use a Grimoire that has a Tier appropriate to your Wizard level.


| Tier | Minimum Wizard level |
| ---- | -------------------- |
| 0    | 1                    |
| 1    | 3                    |
| 2    | 6                    |
| 3    | 9                    |
Each time a Grimoire increases a Tier, it gains some extra special powers based on the part enchanted (Cover, Spine, Pages) and the material used.

### Spells known
At level 1, your Grimoire starts with 3 level 1 spells of your choice from the wizard spell list.

### Spell Research
As a wizard, you are capable of researching and experimenting with magical formulas of existing spells, in hopes of one day, featuring your own name next to a spell.

During a long rest, you can research, experiment and modify an existing spell that you know, can cast and is on the wizard spell list. Additionally, the spell can only be from a level or below that equals your Grimoire's Tier (Tier 0 is cantrips). Furthermore, the spell cannot already contain someone's name in the title (Mordenkainen's Magnificient Mansion, Tasha's Hideous Laughter etc.)

**Step 1:** Pick an eligible spell.
**Step 2:** Pick the target of the spell. (This depends on your chosen spell)

- Yourself or one ally
- One enemy
- All enemies in an area
- All allies in an area
- The spell does damage

**Step 3:** Research.
You do your research during a Long Rest. At the end of the [[Long Rest]], you gain access to the Experimental version of your chosen spell. You can cast this experimental version once before the next long rest, upon which, the unstable formulae breaks down.

While researching, roll on one of the tables below, depending on the target of your spell.

When a table says L, substitute the level of the spell.

**Step 3:** Gain a point of permanent AP that equals the spell's level, until the spell is used or is lost.
