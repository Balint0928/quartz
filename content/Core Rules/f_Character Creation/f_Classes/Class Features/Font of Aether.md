Sorcerers have a wellspring of aether inside of them, marking them as innately magical creatures. This font of aether grants you the following effects:

- Your AP maximum is increased by your CON modifier (minimum 1).
- You gain 2 permanent AP, that can never be reduced.
- You gain an extra spell slot for each spell level you have access to.
- You add your current AP to all damage rolls of spells you cast, even cantrips.
