While you are in an area you are attuned to, you can spend up to 10 minutes meditating or use this feature during your attunement process, and detect creatures within a number of miles equal to your proficiency bonus. This does not reveal their exact position or a specific creature, but it does reveal what creature types are present, and the approximate distance away they are.

You can use this feature once per [[Long Rest]].
