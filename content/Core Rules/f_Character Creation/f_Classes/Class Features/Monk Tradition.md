*You can choose one of the following Monk subclasses:*

### Way of the Sun

- Mantra of the Sun’s Kiss: As an action, you can touch a creature within 5 feet of you, and Spend 1 Spirit to grant them Temporary hit points that equals twice your character level. Only one creature can benefit from this feature at the same time. The temporary hit points last for 1 minute.

- When you use your Focused Spirit's Piercing Palm feature to bypass the AV of a creature, you can spend an extra Spirit to force the creature to succeed on a Con save against your martial Arts DC, or become blinded until the end of its next turn.

### Way of the Moon

- Mantra of the Moon’s Veil: While this mantra is active it reduces the light level around you by 1 increment. (Bright → Dim; Dim → Darkness)

- While you are in dim light or darkness, as a bonus action, you can spend 1 Spirit to benefit from the Invisibility spell until the end of your next turn.

- If you hit an enemy that is Unaware of you, that attack is a critical hit.

### Way of the Warden

- You gain proficiency with a weapon of your choice and you gain [[Weapon Mastery]] with that weapon.

- All effects controlled by the monk that would affect Unarmed attacks, also applies to the monk weapon chosen by the [[Weapon Mastery]]. You may only choose a monk weapon for these effects.
