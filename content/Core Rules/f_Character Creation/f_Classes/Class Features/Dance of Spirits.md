Each druid binds itself to one or more totem spirits. These powerful nature spirits give guidance and power to the druid. The spirit grants a druid an unusual mastery of the winds of magic, and thus the druid is able to channel Aether better and more efficiently than others.

Once per long rest, you can use an action to remove all non-permanent AP from yourself and may add it to a creature of your choice within 20 feet of you. If the creature is unwilling, it can succeed on a wisdom saving throw against your spell save DC. On a success you must choose a different target or regain the AP expended.

Whenever you target a creature with a spell requiring a save, the DC is increased by 1/4th of the current AP of the target (minimum of 1 if they have any AP).
