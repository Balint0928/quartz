During a short rest, when you are using [[Aether Channel]] to regain spell slots, you can open the wellspring of aether within you, to flood yourself and your allies with magic. You can regain extra spell slots, but each slot you gain increases your AP by an amount that equals the level of the slot regained. 

Additionally, each ally can regain 1 extra level of spell slot if they are channeling as well. 

At the end of the channeling, all allies, even non-magical ones gain 2 AP.
