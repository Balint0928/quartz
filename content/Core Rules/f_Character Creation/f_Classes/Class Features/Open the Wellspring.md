During a short rest, when you are using [[Aether Channel]] to reduce AP, you can open the wellspring of aether within you, to flood aether out of you. You use both the AP reducing and the spell slot recovering feature of the channel.

Additionally, each ally can regain 1 extra level of spell slot or loose 1 extra AP (depending on what they channel) if they are channeling as well.
