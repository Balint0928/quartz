When you use your [[Aether Channel]] ability, instead of its normal effect, you can choose to begin a shamanic rite, to appease the spirits and seek counsel. You have a 40% +10% x Your current AP chance that the spirits listen. If they do, you can choose one of the following effects:

- Identify a magic item.
- Summon a familiar bound to you as per the find familiar spell.
- Give you an omen as per the Augury spell.
- Replicate the effect of a Ritual spell of a level that you can cast, and has no GP cost in its components. If the spell is concentration, you have to concentrate on it.

If the spirits don't listen, you can still gain the normal effect of [[Aether Channel]].
