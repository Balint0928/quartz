You can use your built up spirit in the following ways:

- **Flurry of Blows:** Immediately after you take the Attack action on your turn, you can spend 1 Spirit point to make two Unarmed strikes as a bonus action.

- **Step of the Wind:** You can spend 1 Spirit point to take the dash action as a bonus action. When you do so, your movement doesnâ€™t trigger any reactions.

- **Piercing Palm:** You can spend 1 Spirit point when you hit a target with an unarmed strike, to ignore an amount of AV the enemy has that equals your wisdom modifier.
