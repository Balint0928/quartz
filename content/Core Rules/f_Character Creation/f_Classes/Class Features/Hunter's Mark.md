As a bonus action, you can focus your attention and supernatural senses on a creature you can see within 60 feet of you. For the next minute you must concentrate on this effect as if you were concentrating on a spell. 

While the target is marked, you deal an extra 1d6 damage to the target whenever you hit it with a weapon attack, and you have advantage on any [[Martial Knowledge]] checks you make against it. 

If the target drops to 0 hit points before this effect ends, you can use a bonus action on a subsequent turn of yours to mark a new creature. You can use this feature a number of times that equals your wisdom modifier, per [[Long Rest]]
The damage of Hunterâ€™s mark increases to 1d8 at 5th level.
