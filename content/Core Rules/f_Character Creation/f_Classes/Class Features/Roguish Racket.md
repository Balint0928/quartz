### **Assassin:**

- **Assassinate:** If you hit an enemy that is Unaware of you, that attack is a critical hit.

### **Bandit:**

- **Critical Saboteur:** Whenever this Rogue scores a critical hit, the Rogue may destroy a consumable in the creatures possession. They may also reduce the duration of a beneficial ability the creature is benefiting from by a number of increments equal to the proficiency modifier of the Rogue.

- **Instant Gratification:** Whenever the Rogue would successfully steal from an enemy in combat or deal Bleed damage. The rogue may immediately use the item if it is usable. Bleed damage is applied instantly when applied.

### **Swashbuckler:**

- **Panache:** You gain proficiency with a weapon of your choice and you gain [[content/Core Rules/f_Character Creation/f_Classes/Class Roles/Role Features/Weapon Mastery]] with that weapon.

- **Rakish Audacity:** You gain an additional way to use your Sneak Attack; you don't need advantage on your attack roll to use Sneak Attack against a creature if you are within 5 feet of it, no other creatures are within 5 feet of you, and you don't have disadvantage on the attack roll. All the other rules for Sneak Attack still apply to you.
