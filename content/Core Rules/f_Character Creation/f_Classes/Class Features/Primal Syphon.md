When an ally within 20 feet of you, would gain AP, you may take that AP instead as a reaction if they are willing. When you do so, the next spell you cast is treated as upcasted by 1 spell level. You can use this feature a number of times that equals your proficiency bonus, per [[Long Rest]].

This ability cannot be triggered by [[Dance of Spirits]].
