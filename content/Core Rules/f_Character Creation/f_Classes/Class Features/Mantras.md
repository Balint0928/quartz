Once per turn, you can use a bonus action to channel your [[Spirit]] into a mantra, a sacred rite, or chant that grants you certain benefits. Mantras have a trigger condition. When the condition is met, you can use the active mantra as a reaction. A mantra remains active until the end of the combat or until you run out of [[Spirit]]. You can only enter a Mantra if you have at least 1 [[Spirit]].

### Mantra of Retribution:

- Trigger: An enemy within 15 feet lends an attack on you, or an ally within 15 feet of you. 

- You immediately deal Piercing damage to attacker that equals your [[Spirited Defense]]. If you were the target of the attack, you donâ€™t reduce incoming damage as per your [[Spirited Defense]].

### Mantra of Salvation:

- Trigger: An attack hits an ally within 15 feet of you.
- 
- You apply your [[Spirited Defense]] to an ally against the triggering attack. When this happens, reduce your [[Spirit]] as if you were hit by the attack.

### Mantra of Conviction:

- Trigger: You or an ally within 15 feet of you, hits a creature within 15 feet of you with an attack.

- You can spend [[Spirit]] up to your proficiency bonus, and add 1d4/[[Spirit]] damage of the same type of the triggering attack to the damage. This extra damage cannot be increased in any way, not even a critical hit.
