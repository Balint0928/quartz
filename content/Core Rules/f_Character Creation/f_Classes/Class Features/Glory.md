**Glory is a resource that fuels some features. It also represents your current fame.**

### Gaining & Losing Glory:

A Glorious Challenge is an optional objective that can be accepted at the start of a combat encounter. If you complete the sub-objective you will gain a point of Glory. Major encounters such as villains will always grant a point of Glory. If you choose to take the Glorious Challenge and fail to fulfill the optional objective, then you lose a point of Glory.

### Using Glory:

When a feature calls to “Expend” a point of glory, that point of glory is unavailable (but not lost!) until the end of your next long rest.

### Legend:

If you would gain the Glory feature from two sources, your glory points instead become Legend points, which unlock better results when spent. Additionally, Legendary Challenges are more difficult to complete.
