Unlike other classes at level 3, you don't choose a "sub-class". Instead, your chosen bloodline grants you further benefits.

### Aberrant
- Bloodline spell: Mind Spike
- Telepathic Speech: As a bonus action, choose one creature you can see within 30 feet of yourself. You and the chosen creature can communicate telepathically with each other while the two of you are within a number of miles of each other equal to your Charisma modifier (minimum of 1 mile). While this connection is active, your permanent AP increases by 1.
- Psychic Bulwark: You and a creature you are telepathically linked to can add your current AP to any wisdom saving throw, but only one of you, once per turn.

### Divine 
- Bloodline spell: Spiritual Weapon
- Favored by the Gods: If you fail a saving throw, or miss with an attack roll, you can increase your AP by 1 and roll 2d4 and add it to the result. You can use this feature once per [[Long Rest]]
- Empowered healing: Whenever you or an ally within 5 feet of you rolls dice to determine the number of hit points a spell restores, you can use your reaction to add your current AP to the total. After this, increase your AP by 1

### Draconic
- Bloodline spell: Dragon's Breath
- Draconic Resilience: Your HP maximum increases by 3, and it increases by 1 whenever you gain another level.
- Dragon Scales: You add your Charisma modifier to your DV. And you can add your current AP instead of your constitution to any AV rolls. When you do so, increase your AP by 1.

### Shadow
- Bloodline spell: Darkness
- Eyes of the Dark: You gain Darkvision in a range of 60 feet. You can see even in magical darkness.
- Temptation from the shadows: When you are reduced to 0 HP, you can make a Charisma save (DC 5 + damage taken). On a success, you instead drop to 1 HP. You can't use this feature if you are reduced to 0 hit points by radiant damage or by a critical hit. If you fail the save, increase your AP by 5. If you succeed, by 1.

### Wild
- Bloodline spell: *Choose one* 
- Wild magic: Once per turn, you can roll 1d20 and add your current AP, immediately after you cast a Sorcerer spell with a spell slot. If you roll a 20 or the total is higher than 25, roll on the Wild Magic Surge table to create a magical effect. Once the effect is resolved, increase your AP by 1. This can only trigger this way once per combat or once every 10 minutes.
- Tides of Chaos: You can give yourself advantage on a d20 roll of any kind. Once you do so, increase your AP by 2, and the next time you cast a spell with a spell slot, immediately trigger a wild magic surge. You can use this feature once per [[Short Rest]].
