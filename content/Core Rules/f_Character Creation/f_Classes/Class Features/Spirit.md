Spirit shows a monkâ€™s focus and battle readiness that increases as they perform in combat.

You can have a maximum amount of Spirit, that equals your monk level.

You gain or lose Spirit in the following ways:

- When you successfully hit an enemy in combat, gain 1 spirit, 2 on a crit.

- When an enemy deals damage to you with an attack in combat, lose 1 spirit, 2 on a crit.

- If you fall unconscious, lose all of your Spirit.

- Out of combat, you lose all of your Spirit after 1 hour.
