Once per long rest, as a bonus action, you can activate Chant, and empower the next spell you will cast. When you do so, choose one of the following effects:

- +1 to your DC to resist. 
- +2 die of damage.
- Ignore allies in the area of effect.
- If it is a Cantrip, treat the casting as if you were 5 levels higher.
- You cannot gain AP from the casting of the spell nor from losing concentration of it.
