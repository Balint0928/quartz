You can use Inspiration as a reaction whenever you or an ally roll an attack, saving throw or skill check. If you do, you add a bonus to the roll equal to your current AP.

You can use this feature a number of times equal to your Charisma modifier. You regain any expended uses when you finish a short or long rest.
