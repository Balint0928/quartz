You can use your supernatural senses, to attune to your surroundings, and gain better understanding of it.

You must attune to a terrain, or your immediate environment during a 10 minute ritual. Example terrains are: A dungeon floor, A forest, A town, City Sewers. The exact size and borders of your current attuned terrain is up to the discretion of the DM. After the ritual is completed, you gain the following benefits, while you are within the same terrain:

- Difficult terrain doesn't slow your group's travel.

- You can double your proficiency bonus for any navigation checks.

- Even when you are engaged in another activity while traveling (such as foraging, navigating, or tracking), you remain alert to danger.

- You learn one language spoken by natives of the area.

- If you are traveling alone, you can move stealthily at a normal pace.

You can use this feature once per [[Long Rest]].
