You gain Skill Mastery with Arcana. Furthermore, your in-depth study of the arcane arts, allows you to create spell scrolls. This requires [[Scribe Kit]] proficiency. You must expend 100 GP and a day's worth of work to produce a spell scroll that contains a spell that you know. 

If you also have the [[Scribe Kit]]'s [[Arcane inks]] special, the time and cost is halved.
