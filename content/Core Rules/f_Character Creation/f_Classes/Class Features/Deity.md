Clerics choose their deity at first level. Each deity gives the cleric a pool of Divine Focus (4 points). Each point can be Law or Chaos. The other cleric abilities allow the cleric to expend Law or Chaos for extra effects. The composite of law and chaos depends on the deity. Deities have Anathemas, things that go against their divine will. Committing these acts can see you removed from grace.
