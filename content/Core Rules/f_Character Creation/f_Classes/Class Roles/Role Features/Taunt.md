 When a creature leaves your melee reach, you can use your reaction to try and turn its attention towards yourself. Roll a Charisma (Intimidation) or a Charisma (Deception) check against the target creatureâ€™s passive perception. On a success, the creature has advantage on attacks made against you until the end of its turn.
