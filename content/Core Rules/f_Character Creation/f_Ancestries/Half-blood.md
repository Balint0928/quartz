Half bloods are crossbreeds between Humans and another ancestry. Uniquely humans are the only ones able to produce such offsprings. Out of these the rarest is a Half-dwarf, as it is extremely rare that one can be sculpted.

While many half-bloods are ostracized by their parents communities, dwarven half-bloods are regarded as rare miracles and a lot of times are revered and usually beloved by their dwarven communities
