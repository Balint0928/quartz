When a creature takes Bleed damage, the damage is only realized at the start of its next turn. A creature affected by bleed can either use an action to end the bleed immediately, or at the end of its turns it rolls a 1d20. On a 15 or higher, it removes all stacks of Bleed. Bleed damage doesn't stack with other Bleed sources, unless the effect specifically states so.
