When you are reduced to 0 HP, you gain the Dying condition, immediately fall Prone, and suffer a point of [[Exhaustion]].

On your turn, you cannot take actions, bonus actions or reactions. You can only crawl. You can only take an Action, if you suffer two points of [[Exhaustion]], or one point for a Bonus Action.

Casting a spell of any level while downed also increases your AP by an amount that equals the spells level (1 for cantrips) + 1.

If you take damage while Downed, you also gain 1 point of Exhaustion, 2 if you suffer a critical hit.

At the start of each of your turns that you start in the Dying condition, you must roll a Death Saving throw against a DC of 8 + your current Exhaustion. On a success, you gain no Exhaustion. On a fail, you gain 1, on a crit fail, you gain 2. On a natural 20, you regain 1 HP and end the Downed Condition.

If your Exhaustion reaches 10 your character dies.
